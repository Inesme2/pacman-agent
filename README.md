# pacman-agent
This is our Pacman Capture-the-Flag Berkeley project implementation. Currently, we are working on improving the offensive strategy, since it does not detect when the oponent ghosts are scared. Therefore, our Pacman does not try to eat them in this situation. We want to solve this implementing the minimax algorithm.
